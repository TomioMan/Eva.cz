                <h1>THE ORIGINAL SERIES!</h1>
                <p>Yes, this is the original series of the franchise! It is based on
                     the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, not entirely tho, the manga and 
                     the original series both have a different ending, but fundamentally 
                     have the same story.</p>

                <h1>What 'is' Neon Genesis Evangelion?</h1>
                <p>By design, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a psychological horror with mecha elements, 
                    featuring many weird and messed up kinds of mental torture done
                     on its characters, buts its not all gloomy and depressing! 
                     (I promise)</p>
                <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion has all sorts of fun and silly moments 
                    in it, that's what most of the show is about anyway! Just some kids 
                    in giant robots fighting giant alien creatures, right?... right?</p>
                <p>Well... yes, but actually no. From the begining of the show the mood
                     isnt set too light, the main guy needs to do stuff he really 
                     doesnt want to do, but the social pressure of everyone including 
                     his dad forces him to do it anyway, even when He really doesnt want 
                     to. Shinji... is a mess, but more on that later.</p>

                            the giants wanting to end humanity for their sins, but 
                            over the 26 episodes we learn its so much more than just 
                            damage they're after.</p>
                        <p>No one is the show actually calls them by the names, 
                            just by their position. At the start of the show we are 
                            told that there were already two prior angels, which 
                            caused great damage to humanity, se this one, Sachiel, 
                            is the third.</p>

                            Throughout the series, Shinji struggles with having

                            of the show. Piloted by Shinji Ikari, this Eva has a crazy

                            of the team, always jumping into the action with style. 
                            It's strong, fast, and Asuka makes sure it gets the job

                            Neon Genesis Evangelion. She's the cool, confident 
                            operations director at NERV, responsible for leading 
                            the Eva pilots (including Shinji) into battle. <br>
                            <br>
                            Misato is energetic, fun, and caring, but she's also got a more 
                            serious, complex side due to her difficult past. She takes 
                            Shinji in and acts as a sort of big sister/mother figure.</p>

                            the Evangelion project. She's highly intelligent, logical, 
                            and often comes off as cold and detached, but she's got her 
                            own emotional complexities beneath the surface. <br>
                            <br>
                             Ritsuko is close friends with Misato, but she's more focused on the 
                            technical side of things, always working behind the scenes 
                            to make sure the Evas function properly. She also has a 
                            complicated relationship with her mother and Gendo Ikari, 
                            which adds a lot of depth to her character.</p>

                            commander of NERV, and also shinji's father. He's the 
                            mastermind behind the Evangelion project and is willing to 
                            do whatever it takes to achieve his mysterious goals, even 
                            if it means using the people around him, including his own 
                            son. Gendo's complex relationship with Shinji is a key 
                            source of tension in the series, as he is emotionally 
                            distant and manipulative, caring more about his ultimate 
                            plans than being a father figure.</p>

                            government. He's got a casual, flirtatious personality,

                            romantic history. Despite his playful demeanor, Kaji is 
                            deeply involved in uncovering the secrets behind NERV, the 
                            Evas, and SEELE's true intentions. He's smart, resourceful, 
                            and always seems to know more than he lets on.</p>

                <h1>POST-APOCALICTIV WORLD!</h1>
                <p>The world of Evangelion is set in a post-apocalyptic future where 
                    humanity is recovering from a catastrophic event called Second 
                    Impact. This disaster wiped out half the world's population and 
                    caused massive environmental changes. Society is now concentrated 
                    in fortified cities, with the most important one being Tokyo-3, 
                    where NERV headquarters is located.<br>
                    <br>
                    NERV is presented to the public as an organization that exists to 
                    protect humanity from mysterious Angels, which are 
                    attacking Earth for reasons that they dont explain. NERV's 
                    solution is the esvangelions, giant bio-mechanical 
                    mechs designed to fight the Angels. <br>
                    <br>
                    The 'official' story is that these Evas are humanity's best hope for survival, 
                    and NERV is portrayed as the ultimate defense against total 
                    annihilation. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ordinary people don't know about the deeper conspiracies and 
                    secrets involving the true purpose of the Evas, the Angels, and 
                    the nature of Second Impact. They trust that NERV is handling the 
                    situation, and life goes on as normally as possible, despite the 
                    looming threat of Angel attacks.</p>

                <h1>the man himself!</h1>
                <p>Shiro Sagisu is a legendary figure in anime music, most famous for 
                    his emotionally powerful and genre-spanning soundtrack for 
                    Evangelion, but with a body of work that extends far beyond 
                    into other anime and film projects. His music is a key part of 
                    what makes Evangelion so iconic. <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the most recognizable pieces from the series is the upbeat 
                    opening theme, "A Cruel Angel's Thesis," which was performed by Yoko 
                    Takahashi. This song became incredibly famous and is still closely 
                    associated with Evangelion today.</p>
