            <h1>NEON GENESIS EVANGELION</h1>
            <p>Neon genesis evangelion, in it's heart, is a psychological horror TV 
                show, with it's first time airing being October 4, 1995. Evangelion, 
                in short, is about a world were young teenagers have to fight giant 
                beings that 'god' sends to punish humanity for it sins, or at least 
                that's what the viewer is told in the begining of the show.<br>
                <br>
                Throughout the 26 episodes that the original anime has, we learn about
                 many interesting, deeply thought out characters with complex stories
                  and backgrounds, that contribute to not only the growth of them, but 
                  also a growth in the viewer themselves.</p>

                <h1>THE PURPUSE OF THIS WEBSITE</h1>
                <p>Originally, I wanted this website to be just a list of reasons 
                    and many other things that should make you want to watch it too, 
                    but over time it turned out ot be much more than that, and grew 
                    to my heart as my first bigger project. <br>
                <br>
                This website serves as a spoiler-free <strong>(ish)</strong> presentation of Neon 
                Genesis Evangelion, and it's many accomplishments in our beatiful 
                capitalist society.</p> <br>

                <h1>More things you should know</h1>
                <p>All the general information about characters and story are on the 
                    top page, The original series. All of this text was 
                    <strong>carefully and lovingly</strong> handwriten or modified by 
                    me so i hope you'll enjoy my little rambling about the series :)</p>
