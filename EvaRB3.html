                <h1>A COMPLETELY NEW PATH FOR THE STORY</h1>
                <p>Evangelion: 3.0 takes the series in a totally new direction, and it's
                     not like anything fans expected. The story jumps forward, and 
                     everything feels very different—there are new places, new problems,
                      and a much darker and more serious tone. It's clear that the 
                      Rebuild series is no longer following the original at all, which 
                      makes it so surprising and exciting to watch.</p>
                <p>Released in 2012, this movie is full of bold changes and emotional
                     moments. It leaves fans with a lot of questions and really 
                     makes you think about what's coming next. It's very unique 
                     and shows just how far the story can go.</p>

                            (except Asuka, because "Curse of Eva" magic), and Misato 
                            is now leading a new group, Wille, fighting against NERV, 
                            which is doing some shady stuff.</p>

                            just with some new twists. But in 3.0, BAM, 14 years have 
                            passed! Shinji wakes up and has no idea what's going on. 
                            Everything's messed up, earth's wrecked, and all the 
                            characters he knew have changed. It's like he slept through

                <h1>A NEW pilot's in town!</h1>
                <p>Founded after a civil war within NERV a few months after Near Third 
                    Impact, WILLE was founded for the sole purpose of destroying NERV. <br>
                    <br>
                    It's formed by former NERV members who've turned against their old 
                    employer after the catastrophic events of Evangelion: 2.0. Their 
                    goal is to stop NERV and prevent further apocalyptic events caused 
                    by the Evangelion units and the Human Instrumentality Project.<br>
                    <br>
                    The name “WILLE” comes from the German word for “will,” symbolizing 
                    their determination to resist NERV and forge a new path for humanity.</p>
