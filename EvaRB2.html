                <h1>THE STORY TAKES A BIG TURN</h1>
                <p>The first Rebuild movie stayed close to the original, but 
                    Evangelion: 2.0 changes things in a big way. New scenes, 
                    characters, and surprises make the story more exciting and 
                    unpredictable.</p>
                <p>Released in 2009, this movie mixes familiar moments with completely
                     new ideas. It's where the Rebuild series starts to feel 
                     very different from the original, keeping fans guessing and 
                     wanting more.</p>
                <h1>CAUSION!!! if you scroll further there might be spoilers</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="2" class="nadpis_sub">WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN EVANGELION: 2.0?</h2>
        <div class="primary_container">
            <div> <img src="images/evangelionRB2_2.png" style="height: 70vh;" alt=""> </div>
            <div> 
                <h1>FAMILIAR... BUT TOTALLY DIFFERENT</h1>
                <p>Evangelion: 2.0 starts off feeling a lot like the original series, 
                    but then things take a sharp turn. New characters, like Mari, 
                    bring a fresh energy to the story, and even familiar characters 
                    like Asuka get some big changes that make their arcs feel new and 
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>The story itself adds plenty of surprises. While some key moments 
                    from the original are still there, many are completely reimagined 
                    or replaced with new scenes. By the end, the movie has taken the 
                    story in a bold, unexpected direction, setting the Rebuild series 
                    apart as its own unique version of Evangelion.</p>
                <p>Evangelion: 2.0 isn't just a retelling, it's where the Rebuild series 
                    really starts to feel like its own thing, keeping fans guessing 
                    every step of the way.</p>

                <h1>A NEW pilot's in town!</h1>
                <p>Mari  Makinami, AKA the fifth child is on board! Mari Makinami is 
                    one of the biggest additions to the Rebuild series, and she's 
                    nothing like anyone we've seen before. <br>
                    <br>
                    Confident, playful, and totally unpredictable, Mari brings a fresh vibe to the story. 
                    She's not weighed down by the same emotional struggles as the 
                    other pilots, which makes her stand out in a world full of heavy 
                    drama. <br>
                    <br>
                    Mari isn't just a new pilot, she's a wild card, and her presence 
                    hints that the Rebuild series is heading into uncharted territory.</p>
