                <h1>Reimagining THE LEGENDARY STORY</h1>
                <p>The original Neon Genesis Evangelion became super popular for 
                    its exciting story, deep characters, emotional moments and deep themes. 
                    But years passed, and the creators decided it was time to retell 
                    the story for a new generation.</p>
                <p>In 2007, Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone was released, bringing 
                    back the series with amazing animation, a faster story, and some 
                    small changes that showed something bigger might be coming. It's 
                    great for people who never saw the original and exciting for fans 
                    who loved it before.</p>
                <h1>CAUSION!!! if you scroll further there might be spoilers</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="2" class="nadpis_sub">Basically going in the rails of the original</h2>
        <div class="primary_container">

            <div> 
                <h1>A FRESH TAKE ON A CLASSIC STORY</h1>
                <p>While Evangelion: 1.0 follows the same basic story as the first few 
                    episodes of the original series, there are plenty of changes that 
                    make it feel fresh and new. The most obvious difference is the 
                    animation, it's brighter, smoother, and packed with stunning modern 
                    visuals that make every battle and emotional moment even more 
                    intense.</p>
                <p>The pacing is faster, too. Some scenes are streamlined or changed 
                    slightly, which keeps the story moving quickly while still 
                    capturing all the key moments fans loved in the original.
                    There are also small hints of new ideas sprinkled throughout, 
                    teasing that the Rebuild series might be heading in a different 
                    direction later on. Even longtime fans will notice tiny details 
                    that feel fresh or surprising.</p>
